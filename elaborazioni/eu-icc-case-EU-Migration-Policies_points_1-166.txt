Executive Summary

1. The present communication provides the Prosecutor with evidence implicating European Union and Member States’ officials and agents in Crimes Against Humanity, committed as part of a premeditated policy to stem migration flows from Africa via the Central Mediterranean route, from 2014 to date.

2. The evidence establishes criminal liability within the jurisdiction of the Court, for policies resulting in i) the deaths by drowning of thousands of migrants, ii) the refoulement of tens of thousands of migrants attempting to flee Libya, and iii) complicity in the subsequent crimes of deportation, murder, imprisonment, enslavement, torture, rape, persecution and other inhuman acts, taking place in Libyan detention camps and torture houses.

3. Relying on agreements concluded with Muammar Gaddafi, the European Union’s border externalization policy thus collapsed together with his regime in 2011. Consequently, in 2014 the European Union resorted to a deterrence-based migration policy, which ignored the plight of migrants in distress at sea, in order to dissuade others in similar situation from seeking safe haven in Europe (EU’s 1st Policy).

4. The EU’s 1st Policy turned the central Mediterranean to the world’s deadliest migration route. Between January 1st, 2014 and end of July, 2017, over 14,500 people died or were reported missing. Two incidents in one week in April 2015 alone cost the lives of 1,200 people.5

5. While migrant crossings were not reduced the death toll drastically increased. Gradually, Search and Rescue (‘SAR’) operations operated by NGOs took on the activities previously carried out by the EU. Consequently, in 2015 the EU renewed its border externalization policy.

6. The EU’s second policy (EU’s 2nd Policy) ousted the NGOs from the Mediterranean and dramatically deepened cooperation with the Libyan Coast Guard (‘LYCG’). In a context where the European Union (‘EU’) and its Member States (‘MS’) accepted that push-backs to Libya are strictly unlawful this new configuration effectively enabled the outsourcing of this new policy to the LYCG.

7. In lieu of the lawful rescue and safe disembarkation previously operated by rescue NGOs, the LYCG became a key actor in the interception and unlawful refoulement of migrants attempting to flee Libya.

8. Through a complex mix of legislative acts, administrative decisions and formal agreements, the EU and its MS provided the LYCG with material and strategic support, including but not limited to vessels, training and command & control capabilities.

9. To maximize the number of migrants disembarking at Libyan ports the EU and its MS channeled their policies through the LYCG by directly commanding, instructing and providing them with information, such as the location of migrant boats in distress.

10. Without the involvement of the EU and its MS, the LYCG had no capacity or will to intercept migrants seeking to exit Libya and detain them in camps. Without the implementation of EU’s 2nd Policy, therefore, the crimes against the targeted population would not have ever occurred.

11. Through the EU’s 2nd Policy the commission of these crimes amount to a widespread and organised attack against a civilian population designed to deter immigration, the deadliest campaign the ICC has ever had jurisdiction over.

12. This widespread and systematic campaign was (and still is) directed against persons in need of international protection, at their most vulnerable moment: when they were in distress at sea, facing death by drowning.

13. In order to avoid duties arising under maritime law and human rights law, the EU orchestrated a policy of forced transfer to detention facilities, where crimes were (and still are) committed.


14. Between 2016 and 2018, more than 40,000 victims were intercepted and transported to detention facilities, where various crimes within the meaning of the Rome Statute would be committed. The attempts by migrants to cross the Central Mediterranean continue, as do the disastrous consequences.6

15. EU and MS officials and agents carefully designed and meticulously implemented a highly coordinated naval border control operations, with full awareness of the lethal consequences of their conduct.

16. In January 2017, for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel received a diplomatic cable from its Embassy in Niger, which described Libyan detention facilities as a place where “[e]xecutions… torture, rapes, blackmail and abandonment in the desert are the order of the day … the most serious, systematic human rights violations… concentration-camp-like [conditions]".7

17. In August 2017, the Italian Deputy Minister acknowledged this enterprise of collective and organized expulsion of tens of thousands migrants, orchestrated by the EU and Italy, meant “taking them [the migrants] back to hell”.8 The ICC Prosecutor described Libya as “a marketplace for the trafficking of human beings”,9 while French President Emmanuel Macron stated that it constituted “a crime against humanity”.10

18. The President of theAfrican Union also described the situation in Libya as “shocking” and “scandalous”.11 Buthealso insisted on identifying thepotentialperpetrators of these crimes: “we must establish the responsibilities... in Libya there is no government, so the European Union cannot … ask that country to detain refugees… the refugees are in terrible conditions... the European Union is responsible”.12

19. In hindsight, the architects of the concerned EU policies acknowledged their wrongdoing. They described it as a “huge mistake”13, one that “cost human lives”.14 But this was no mistake. Evidence provided in this communication indicates these policies were part of an intentional plan, with full and real-time knowledge of its lethal consequences.

20. Based on the foreknowledge of the widespread and systematic crimes committed in Libya, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial or Arbitrary Executions, Ms. Callamard, stated that “[t]he International Criminal Court should consider preliminary investigation into atrocity crimes against refugees and migrants”15.

21. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Mr. Melzer, described the root causes of these crimes: “migration laws, policies and practices that knowingly or deliberately subject or expose migrants to foreseeable acts or risks of torture or ill-treatment… are “conclusively unlawful”.16

22. Mr. Melzer joined Ms. Callamard in calling the ICC-Prosecutor to “examine whether investigations for crimes against humanity or war crimes are warranted in view of the scale, gravity and increasingly systematic nature of torture, ill-treatment and other serious human rights abuses […] as a direct orindirect consequence of deliberate State policies and practices of deterrence, criminalization, arrival prevention, and refoulement.”

23. The crimes committed against migrants are well-documented, including by various EU agencies. The evidence concerning the prior knowledge of EU and Member State officials and agents with respect to the outcomes for deportees is also evidenced in their own statements and official documents.

24. The sole remaining question to be investigated by the Prosecutor is therefore the applicable mode of liability of the different actors in connection with the different crimes, and the distribution of responsibilities through the various actors involved.

25. ICC investigation on the situation in Libya has been pending for eight years. The criminal attack against migrants has been taking place over the past five years and is still ongoing.

26. The evidence presented in this communication concerns the most responsible actors. The Office of the Prosecutor is respectfully requested to hold these individuals accountable.

“This is horrific… the hypocrisy, the cynicism of those in the European union, the European Commission but as well … the European Council… that are pretending that they are saving lives, they know very well that in Libya there is no such thing as the Libyan Coast Guard, what there are militias, militias operated by all sort of criminals, networks… they are the one who are being paid by the European Union to pretend they are fictional Libyan Coast Guard to indeed push back the migrants that are the ones who exploit the migrants, who sell the migrants… what is tremendous is the complicity of the EU…”

1. Facts

1.1 Background: The Rise and Fall of EU’s Gatekeeper (1998-2015)17

1.1.1 The rise (1998-2011)

1. Prior to theimplementation of theEUDublin Convention in 1990, Libyahad relatively open borders and accepted many Sub-Saharan Africans to work in the country. However, following the adoption of the Convention and realizing the political advantage to be gained, Libya began to use migration control as a bargaining chip with the European Union.18

2. The ‘Joint Communication’ and ‘Verbal Process’ was the first agreement signed between Italy and Libya in 1998 which affirmed their intention to cooperate towards the ‘prevention of and fight against illegal immigration’.19 This agreement was the premise for the 2008 ‘Treaty of Friendship’ signed by Berlusconi and Gaddafi.20

3. The second written agreement between Italy and Libya was the 2002 ‘Memorandum of Intent’which called for the cooperation of the police forces of the two countries in the fight against ‘illegal immigration’.21 Accordingly, in the early 2000’s Gaddafi started recruiting less migrant workers22 and started imposing discriminatory policies on immigration.23

4. As a result of several factors, however, crossings increased.24 The 2003 agreement between Italy and Libya, which has never been made public, reportedly involved the exchange of information on migrant flows and the provision to Libya of specific equipment to control sea and land borders.25

5. Reports indicate that as of 2003, Italy started financing migration detention camps near Tripoli, Sebah and Kufra.26 Also, Italy began deporting migrants arriving on Italian land to Libya, by air.27

6. Finally, in August 2004, during a meeting between Berlusconi and Gaddafi, Italy agreed to provide training, technology and equipment to “help Libya curb irregular immigration”.28 According to a European Parliament Resolution from 14 April 2005, this agreement gave Libya the “task of supervising migration and [...] readmitting people returned by Italy”.29

7. Shortly after, on 11 October 2004, the EU lifted its economic sanctions and arms embargo on Libya – a move that had been campaigned for by Italy, arguing that weapons were necessary for Libya to combatAfrican “irregular migration”.30

8. In June 2005, EU Justice and Home Affairs Council endorsed a Council Conclusion on cooperation with Libya on migration issues, including the implementation of several ad-hoc measures such as reinforcing systemic cooperation between national services responsible for sea borders, developing common Mediterranean Sea operations involving the deployment of EU vessels and aircraft. Measures also included training of Libyan officials.31

24 In 2001 5,504 migrants were intercepted in Sicily compared to 18,225 in 2002. See Monzini P.,AbdelAziz, N., Pastore, F., 2015, The Changing Dynamics of Cross-border Human Smuggling and Trafficking in the Mediterranean, page 33, online, www.iai.it/sites/default/files/newmed\_monzini.pdf

27 From October 2004 to March 2006 3,043 migrants who had landed in Sicily from Libya were sent back to Libya. See Paoletti, E., ‘Relations Among Unequals?

9. In this context the EU and Italy turned towards Gaddafi to stem migration flows. Italy envisioned to replicate theAlbanian model from 1997 which had included joint patrols in Albanian territorial waters to push-back migrants crossing the sea.32.

10. Accordingly, on 29 December 2007, Italy and Libya signed an agreement on the joint patrolling of coasts, ports and bays of Northern Libya to prevent irregular migration.33

11. Libya under Gaddafi was already a country with no safeguards nor mechanisms to hold the government responsible for violating rights of migrants: Libya had no domestic asylum legislation, Libya has never internationally ratified the 1951 Refugee convention, and never entered into a formal agreement with the UNHCR.

12. Yet, and whilst being perfectly aware of these facts, the EU and Italy decided to make theLibyan Regime their main partner in their border externalization strategy. Accordingly, Gaddafi started imposing more restrictions on Africans coming to Libya, including detention.

13. As part of this strategy, in January 2008, for example, Italy committed to giving 6 patrol boats to Libya and the Italian Parliament approved the allocation of €6 million Euros to the Guardia di Finanza, the customs police, to undertake this task.34

14. On 31 August 2008, Gaddafi and Berlusconi signed a $5 billion deal: the ‘Treaty of Friendship’.35 This money was framed as reparations for the damaging effects of colonization. Over 25 years, Italy would pay for infrastructure projects in exchange for privileged access to resources, such as oil, and collaboration in the ‘fight against illegal migration’.36 The preamble of the ‘Treaty of Friendship’ says “Italy’s important contribution in bringing the embargo to an end”, acknowledging its role in the end of the EU embargo in 2004.37

15. Article 19 in the Treaty of Friendship specifically called for the implementation of the December 2007 agreement (joint patrolling) as well as the realization of a satellite surveillance system along Libya’s Southern border.38

16. According to this ‘push-back’ agreement, Gaddafi would keep refugees and migrants in Libya, the Italian authorities would return anybody leaving Libya irregularly,39 and migrants would be subjected to mass detention, notably in six detention camps that were built with Italian funds.40

17. On 4 February 2009, AdditionalProtocolto theDecember 2007 Agreementfurther specified the nature of the collaboration on migration and expanded its scope: maritime patrols were to include joint crews from the two countries in Libyan and international waters.41

18. The patrol boats promised in 2008 were delivered, and joint patrols started in May 2009. This is also when direct refoulement on the high-seas began.42 Between 6 May 2009 and 6 November 2009, for example, 834 persons were pushed back and diverted to Libya.43

19. Between 2009 and 2010, the Italians intercepted many boats and delivered further 10 fast patrolboatsto theLYCG.44 In June2010 UNHCR wasbriefly expelled fromthecountry by Gaddafi under the auspices that they were ‘operating illegally’.45

20. The fall of Gaddafi marked the cessation of EU and Italy push-back and off-shore detention policy.46 But as established below, the legacy of institutionalized refoulement and detention of migrants which started under Gaddafi with the ‘Treaty of Friendship’ lives on today. As the next section demonstrates, in spite of the ever worsening conditions and the unlawfulness of their policy, the European Union and Italy acted in concert to restore their Gaddafi-era migration policy, at all costs.


1.1.2 The fall (2011-2015)

21. During the 2011 war in Libya, the Libyan Coast Guard (LYCG) had no political will nor technical competency to participate, let alone coordinate, search and rescue (SAR) operations. In fact, the LYCG was the enemy: LYCG was involved in combating against NATO forces, and NATO classified and subsequently targeted LYCG assets as enemy naval assets.47

22. Consequently, the equipment handed over to Libya by Italy for the implementation of EU-Italy externalized border control during the Gaddafi era was targeted, severely damaged or destroyed. In November 2012, Italian agents visited the port in Tripoli to assess the conditions of the assets Italy had handed over to Libya, found them in poor condition and sent them out of Libya until as late as 2017.48

23. On 23 February 2012, the European Court for Human Rights (‘ECtHR’) rendered its landmark ruling in the Hirsi case.49 The ECtHR determined that Italy must have known the situation in Libyaduring theGaddafiregimecould notbeconsidered safe, thatItaly had violated theprinciple of non-refoulement by pushing migrants intercepted in the high seas back to a country they fled from and in which their lives would be at risk.50

24. Based on the situation in Libya, the ECtHR also held that the 1st Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the parties was insufficient “to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment where… reliable sources have reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities which are manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention.”51

25. Despite the decision in the Hirsi case, only a month later (April 2012) Italy signed a second Memorandum of Understanding with Libya (the ‘2nd MoU’). The 2nd MoU provided, again, for the exchange of liaison officers, readmission agreement, training activities for Libyan agents and even the recovery of detention centers.52

26. About a year after Italy signed the 2nd MoU, on 22 May 2013, EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) Libya operation, was launched,53 with a Frontex Officer part of the Mission.54

27. But because of the situation in Libya, both EU operation and Italy’s 2nd MoU failed: armed conflict, civil war, lack of government, and power divided between armed militias, city-states and tribes, prevented EU and Italy from re-imposing their externalized border control policies55. Consequently, in 2014, EUBAM mission control was moved to Tunisia due to the security situation in Libya.56

28. Severely weakened by the conflict, in 2015,57 LYCG was responsible for only 0.5% of the 153,143 migrants who were either rescued or intercepted at sea.58 As a result of the political and legal collapse of the Libyan-based EU migration policy, the EU and Italy shifted their policy of border externalization to pre-Libyan and post-Libyan territories.

29. One of the ‘pre-Libya’efforts was the Khartoum Process, which was initiated in November 2014 at a high-level meeting between the EU and 28 African states,59 continued in November 2015 attheEU’sVallettaSummit,60 and resulted in thecreation of theEUTrustFund for Africa(‘EUTF’). Similar to its Italian equivalent, Fondo Africa,61 the EUTF consisted of EU ‘aid’ to multiple countries along the migration route to ‘contribute to better migration management and to address the root causes’[emphasis added].62 For several recipientAfrican countries of this aid, for example, Niger, the funding was not used for humanitarian purposes, but to improve the capacity of the Nigerien police and military to manage borders.63

30. The EUTF complemented existing Common Security and Defense Policies (CSDP) for long-term capacity building in Libya.64 CSDP had ‘delivered tangible effect through the development of trust and credibility with key Libya interlocutors’, and the EU wanted this partnership to be better exploited with an increased cooperation on the ground.65

31. The EUTF would be the main financial mechanism through which the EU would later channel funds to Libyan fractions in order to stem migration in the Central Mediterranean route during 2016-2017. By the end of 2018, the EU had provided the EUTF with €286 million.66

32. The ‘post-Libya’ efforts reflected in parallel a switch from departure prevention to arrival prevention strategy through the implementation of a deterrence-based policy of premeditated and intentional practice of non-assistance to migrant boats in distress at sea. As described below, EU agencies and agents intentionally created a lethal gap in the relevant SAR zone, in an area under the effective control of the EU and its Member States actors.

33. The purpose of intentionally distancing EU vessels from that area was twofold: to manipulate the law in bad faith in order to: (1) avoid international duties and obligations arising from EU control over the region commanded, and (2) to cause the death by drowning of innocent civilians, in order to deter and impact the behavior of others seeking to flee Libya.

34. As the next section further establishes, EU agents had foreknowledge that this policy change, specifically the decision to move from the Italian Operation Mare Nostrum to the EU Frontex JOTriton, would result in lethal consequences of thousands preventable deaths. The “Black April” incidents which took the lives of 1200 asylum seekers in one week, would become paradigmatic examples of the consequences of such change.

1.2 1st EU policy: The Mediterranean (2013-2015)

1.2.1 Background: Mare Nostrum

The Left to Die Boat (2011)

35. On March 26th 2011, 72 migrants left Tripoli by boat with the aim of reaching Europe. After running out of fuel, the boat was left to drift for 14 days, and was eventually washed up on the Libyan shore with only 10 survivors, who were subsequently imprisoned. One of them eventually died for lack of medical care, and eventually, the 9 survivors were released after which they fled the country.67

36. Beyond thedeathsthemselves, theharrowing partof thiseventisconcreteevidenceshowing that EU actors actively avoided rescuing the boat. Member State and NATO forces that were informed of the migrants’vessel’s distress included a French military aircraft, MRCC Rome, NATO headquarters, NATO Task Force and NATO naval assets.68 Specifically, upon learning of the distressed boat, the Italian and Maltese Maritime Rescue Coordination Centers “failed” to launch the necessary SAR operation. NATO actors also “failed” to react to the call for distress.69

37. Following the “incident”, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe “launched its own investigation in order to establish what happened and who might be responsible for failing to go to the rescue of these people.”70 In Resolution 1872 (2012), the Parliamentary Assembly held that the MRCC Rome “did not ensure that the passengers were rescued. It failed to contact the vessels which were close to the boat in distress and to request them to rescue these boat people. Since it was known that the Libyan SAR zone was not covered, Italy, as the first State to receive the distress call, should have taken responsibility for the co-ordination of the SAR operation.”71

71 Ibid., § 7


38. Resolution 1872 found a failure by “individual member States” and indicated that “[i]t was foreseeable that there would be an exodus of people fleeing the country, including by the dangerous sea route.”72

39. The Parliamentary Assembly urged States to “fill the vacuum of responsibility for SAR zones left by a State which cannot or does not exercise its responsibility for search and rescue, as was the case for Libya […] In the case in question, two Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres (Rome and Malta) were aware that the boat was in distress, but neither started a SAR operation. The Rome MRCC was the first to be informed of the distress situation, and thus had a greater responsibility to ensure the boat’s rescue”.73

40. In 2011, the‘Leftto DieBoat’incidentwastheexception. Yearslater, and expressly contrary to the recommendations laid out by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, it would become official EU policy.


The Lampedusa Shipwrecks (2013)

41. In spite of amounting public pressure to resolve the situation, the migration crisis continued to escalate. As a result of regional dynamics, described by Forensic Oceanography in its Death by Rescue report, crossings from Libya began to increase dramatically as of Summer 2013, and were occurring in more and more precarious circumstances.

42. On 3 October 2013, in the most fatal migrant shipwreck at the time, a boat carrying 500 migrants sank less than one kilometer away from the shore of Lampedusa, claiming the lives of at least 366 people.74

43. Afew days later, on 11 October 2013, a Libyan vessel shot at a boat carrying a group of 400 migrants, mainly Syrian refugees, heading towards Lampedusa. Several passengers were wounded, the vessel was damaged, and its passengers contacted MRCC Rome.75

44. Again, EU coordination of the SAR operation failed. By the time an Italian vessel reached the site, over 200 people had died.76


Mare Nostrum

45. Following the preventable deaths of hundreds of migrants, several meetings took place at the EU Justice and HomeAffairs, where ministers gathered to identify policies to prevent and better respond to future shipwrecks. But no substantial efforts were implemented following these meetings. On 18 October 2013, the Italian government launched its own SAR operation, Mare Nostrum (MN), the largest humanitarian operation in the Mediterranean.77

46. MN was charged with two objectives: “intercepting and rescuing all migrants’ vessels departing from the Libyan coasts” [emphasis added]78 as well as “bringing to justice human traffickers and migrant smugglers.”79

47. Overall, the operation concerned an area of 70,000 square kilometers [20,408.734 squared nautical miles] of the Mediterranean Sea encompassing the SAR zones of Italy, Libya and Malta.80 The initial operating budget for MN was of 9.5 million Euros per month, funded virtually solely by the Italian Government.81

From Mare Nostrum to Triton: Deterrence as an Organizational Policy

48. Despite the large scale deaths, Mare Nostrum was in many ways hugely successful, rescuing 150,810 migrants over a 364-day period.82

49. However, critiques of Mare Nostrum began in summer of 2014 between Italy, Frontex, and the European Commission, when politicians representatives of EU agencies such as Frontex criticized the operation for its alleged effects on the dynamics of migration.

81 Slovenia was the only other European country to support the operation by sending a vessel to assist in SAR missions (seeAgenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata, 2018, “Da MareNostrum a Sophia, il profilo delle missioni di salvataggio tra Italie e Ue”, European Data News Hub, online, https://www.ednh.news/it/da-mare-nostrum-a-triton-il-profilo-delle-missioni-di-salvataggio-tra-italia-e-ue/ , accessed 08/04/2019).

50. The debates centered around two key issues: (1) the “pull factor” hypothesis, which criticized Mare Nostrum for motivating more migrants to arrive on the Italian coast83, and (2) the “death factor” argument, which criticized Mare Nostrum for leading smugglers to shift their strategies and organize crossings in more hazardous conditions, thus increasing the risk of death for migrants during the crossing.84

51. But statistics from Frontex Risk Analysis Quarterly for the period of July to September 2013 indicate that the most significant increase in crossings occurred starting in 2011, and then again as of Summer 201385 as result of the increase crossings by Horn of Africa and in Syrian refugees86, and the collapse of the transition process in Libya, increasing levels of violence experienced particularly by migrants along their route through Libya.87 This increase thus occurred before Mare Nostrum was in effect. According to Forensic Oceanography, “[crossings] resulted from deeper regional political factors that were leading to this trend before MN. [..] the fact that MN was not the major cause is further confirmed by the comparable scale of crossings after MN.”88

84Ibid., p. 5-7. The unfounded belief that Mare Nostrum had encouraged migrants to cross the Mediterranean was widespread. For example, on October 15th, 2014, during a governmental question period, the UK Foreign Office Minister Lady Anelya criticized search and rescue operations as an “unintended ‘pull factor’, encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths,” arguing that the focus should be on “countries of origin and transit, as well as taking steps to fight the people smugglers who willfully put lives at risk by packing migrants into unseaworthy boats.” UK Parliament, 2014, “Lords Hansard text for 15 Oct 2014: Column WA41”, p. 2, online, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/141015w0001.htm , accessed 27/02/2019.

Compared to detections during every other quarter in 2012 and 2013 the increase was both sudden and dramatic to a total of over 22 000 detected migrants.” Mare Nostrum, however, did not come into effect until October 2013, i.e. well after the July to September 2013 period

52. In addition, the “more deaths” criticism against Mare Nostrum can likewise be refuted. According to FA, increase in deaths was not causally related to Mare Nostrum, but was related to factors that already had impact before MN: the worsening conditions in Libya, and the worsening smuggling boat conditions.89 Also, MN’s scope was beyond the area of increased risk of migrant death.90

53. Finally, for the same period examined, death tolls were much higher post-Mare Nostrum in 2015 under Triton (1687 deaths), than during Mare Nostrum in 2014 (60 deaths), proving that the discursive argument that was used to dismantle a humanitarian operation turned out to be false.91


1.2.2 Policy: Triton

54. EU officials sought to end MN to allegedly reduce the number of crossings and deaths. However, not only the crossings were not reduced, but the death toll was 30-fold higher.

55. This was not a mistake. The evidence below establishes that EU agencies and agents were fully awareof thelethalconsequencesof ending MareNostrum, beforethedecision on itstermination was made.

56. Likewise, the decision not to restore MN’s operation and to proceed with the policy change even after being cognizant of its ongoing lethal consequences, also demonstrates the mens rea of the involved actors.

57. Beyond the political considerations, financial factors also played a role in the decision to end MN.92 The lack of solidarity of the European Union actors with Italy made its position more and more untenable. Throughoutthespring and summer of 2014, Italian statementsand institutional debates on having MN operating under Frontex, whilst the organization would take the lead in EU border control, took place, with no results.93


89 Ibid., p. 7-9.

90 Ibid., p. 9.

91 Between January and April 2014 26 000 individuals crossing resulted in 60 deaths, and between January and April 2015 for a similar number of individuals crossing, it resulted in 1687 deaths. While it cannot be said that ending Mare Nostrum in itself directly caused deaths, after Triton replaced Mare Nostrum, the risk of dying therefore increased 30-fold with 2 deaths in 1000 crossings to 60 in 1000:“Theending ofMNwas thus justifiedontheargumentthatMNwasthecauseofmorearrivalsand moredeaths.However, if, as we have demonstrated, increased crossings and deaths were related to deeper regional factors, discontinuing Mare Nostrum would not lead to less crossings but to more deaths at sea. This forecast was available to EU policy makers and agencies, and yet, as the following sections will show, they decided to end MN and (not)replace it with a more limited Frontex operation in all knowledge of the deadly consequences this policy would have.” Heller, C., Pezzani, L., 2016, “Death by Rescue”, p. 10, Forensic Oceanography, online, https://deathbyrescue.org/, accessed 08/04/2019.

92 Already having received additional help by the EU in November 2013 with 1.8 million Euros. See Carrera, S., Den Hertog, L., 2015, “Whose Mare? Rule of law challenges in the field of European border surveillance in the Mediterranean,” p. 3, Liberty and Security, no. 79, online, https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/LSE\_79.pdf , accessed 27/02/2019.


58. The new policy was envisioned to be much more limited than Mare Nostrum. HomeAffairs Commissioner Malmström stated after the EU Minister of Interiors and Minister of Justice Informal Meeting on July 9, 2014 in Milan that she was discussing with Mr. Alfano, the Italian Interior Minister, a “scaled-down” version of MN, given the limits of means to support the operation.94

59. As established below, the “limits of means” was not the real reason for scaling down the extent of protection in an area under theoretical EU actors’ effective control. After Triton - the scaled-down policy that replaced MN - failed, the EU suddenly found indeed the additional means to expand the operation.

60. On August 28th 2014, Frontex issued a document setting out the plan for the future trajectory of Frontex’s pre-existing border patrol operations, Hermes and Aeneas. The proposal was to either extend Hermes, if Mare Nostrum was continued or upgraded, to a new operation -“Triton” – or to merge the operational zones of Hermes and Aeneas if Mare Nostrum was terminated.

61. By joining these two operational zones and removing Mare Nostrum, the European Union essentially carved the entire Southern part of what was previously covered by Mare Nostrum out of its operational scope, drawing the limits of Triton much closer to EU shores.95

62. The envisioned operational scope of Triton was within an area up to 30 nautical miles from the Italian coastline of Lampedusa, leaving around 40 nautical miles of key distress area off the coast of Libya uncovered.96

93 On April 16th, 2014 the Italian Ministry of Interior, Angelino Alfano announced that “Frontex will have to take on a leading role indirectingandcoordinatingpatrollingintheMediterranean.”ByJune24th, 2014, theItalianPrimeMinisterMatteoRenziexpressed that Italy would make a formal request at the EU Council Summit to ensure that “MN becomes an operation part of Frontex.” See Camera dei Deputati, 2014, “Resoconto stenografico dell’Assemblea Seduta”, n. 251, online, http://www.camera.it/leg17/410?idSeduta=0251\&tipo=stenografico, accessed 27/02/2019.

Operation Hermes covered the areas of the Pelagic Islands and Sicily (excluding Malta), the area south of Sardinia, and included a Common PatrollingArea (CPA) which covered the east of Sicily. OperationAeneas consisted of the operational areas ofApulia and Calabria, along the Ionian Sea coast and part of the Adriatic sea coast.

63. Triton employed significantly fewer vessels compared to MN. Whilst MN included 6 helicopters, 4 offshore patrol vessels, frigates and amphibious vessels, Triton only had one helicopter, one offshore patrol vessel and no frigates or amphibious vessels.97

64. In terms of financing, with an initial budget of 1.5—2.9 million Euros per month, it operated with on one third less of a budget than Mare Nostrum (9.5 million Euros), even though the latter was a national program, whilst Triton benefited from the support of 28 EU Member States.98

65. With a mandate as a border control operation, Triton would only be allowed to carry out SAR operations beyond the 30 nautical miles, and only if called on by the Italian Coast Guard.99

66. Hence, contrary to the practice under Mare Nostrum, the waters immediately off the coast of Libya would not be actively patrolled, severely limiting the search and rescue ability of Triton’s operations to act in accordance with international human rights law, by knowingly and intentionally risking and sacrificing the lives of individuals in the High Seas, under the effective control of the EU that previously were covered by MN.

67. As described below, when planning was translated to implementation, the natural consequence of the creation of a zone lacking any form of SAR operations, a zone which happened to be the one where they were most needed – was that boats would be left to drift for a period of days from the moment of distress until a competent SAR vessel to reach them, given that Triton’s vessels were now posted much further away from Libya’s coast.100

68. Before the adoption of the policy still in the planning phase, EU officials did not shy away from acknowledging that Triton was an inadequate replacement for Mare Nostrum, and that the consequences of such an incomplete policy would be dire in terms of the cost of human lives.

69. An internal Frontex report from 28August 2014 acknowledged that: “the withdrawal of naval assets from the area, if not properly planned and announced well in advance – would likely result in a higher number of fatalities.”101

70. Furthermore, Frontex representatives were quoted as stating: “‘Of course, wewillalso do searchand rescueactions, butif you don’thaveenough capacity will you be there in time? I would expect many more sea deaths the moment that Mare Nostrum is withdrawn.”102

71. Also publicly EU officials commented that Triton was an inadequate replacement. For example, GilArias, the Frontex Interim Executive Director announced on 4 September 2014: “joint operation Triton will not replace Mare Nostrum. Neither the mandate, nor the available resources, allow for that replacement.”103

72. Despite this public rhetoric, the EU ultimately decided to launch Triton on 1 November, 2014, coming into full effect on 1 January 2015 after Mare Nostrum had been entirely phased out, without implementing any further compensatory policy.104

73. The fatal effects of Triton’s limited mandate, combined with the end of Mare Nostrum, were immediately observed. The Maritime Rescue and Coordination Center (MRCC) based in Rome began calling on Frontex to carry out SAR operations outside of the new rescue zone.105

74. In response, Klaus Rösler, the Frontex Director of Operations Division responded with a letter on 25 November 2014 to the Italian General Director of Immigration and Border Police, Giovanni Pinto, clarified that border control is Triton’s primary mandate by stating that it is outside the scope of Frontex to deploy assets outside of its operational area.

75. Rösler further noted that only after “indication of a state of emergency” could deployment of SAR vessels be justified, implying that boats of migrants in distress at sea would not qualify as a state of emergency.106

76. According to EU agents themselves, the limited scope of Triton served the purpose of deterrence, in order to dissuade migrants from crossing the Mediterranean. Deterrence, therefore, under EU policy meant sacrificing the innocent lives of the few, in order to impact the potential future behavior of the many.

77. Frontex JO Triton 2015 Tactical Focused Assessment published on 14 January 2015 establishes the Mens Rea for this inhumane policy and its underlying crimes: “The end of Operation Mare Nostrum on 31 December 2014 will have a direct impact on the JO Triton 2014. The fact that most interceptions and rescue missions will only take place inside the operational area could become a deterrence for facilitation networks and migrants that can only depart from, the Libyan or Egyptian coast with favourable weather conditions and taking into account that the boat must now navigate for several days before being rescued or intercepted.”107

78. The EU would quickly learn that their plan of underfunding required SAR operations under international law, would not deter individuals from making the journey. Instead of acting as a deterrence, migrant crossings continued with the number of those arriving between January and April 2015 almost equal to levels of migrant crossing between January to April 2014.108

79. EU officials were however far from discovering these effects. During the planning of their shift in operations, they had been repeatedly warned that the ending of MN would not lead to less crossings, only more deaths.

80. Tineke Strik, rapporteur for the human rights body of the Council of Europe, expressed his concerns regarding the consequences of this SAR vacuum, showing that they were predictable for anyone following the subject, stating that: “we know that [under Triton] there will be gaps and a vacuum in the territorial waters off Libya, for instance, and that is where the main accidents occur.”109

81. As this gap in SAR abilities opened up after the implementation of Triton, Frontex was aware of itseffectsin termsof shifting theburden of recueonto commercialvessels, whichwereforced to respond to the SAR gap created. Frontex likewise stated in its January 2015 tactical assessment of Triton that: “facilitation networks will continue to exploit the presence of civilian merchant ships in the central Mediterranean during 2015 to reach Italy.”110

82. Indeed, commercial vessels were quickly forced to respond to more and more distress calls the SAR gap created. Also this development has been envisioned by the responsible EU actors, as outlines in Frontex statement in its 2015 tactical assessment of Triton: “facilitation networks will continue to exploit the presence of civilian merchant ships in the central Mediterranean during 2015 to reach Italy.”111

83. Not only EU and MS agencies and agents were aware of the inevitable outcome of such policy change, but also private actors have tried to warn the relevant EU bodies, in real-time, of the lethal consequences of their policy.

84. Specifically, the private sector reminded the EU that the vacuum created by shifting from MN to Triton, would be filled by occasional private actors lacking the know-how to conduct a SAR operation and whose involvement in SAR operations could have fatal results, as the Black April cases described below proved.

85. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the European Community Ship-owners Associations (ECSA) published a letter on 31 March 2015 addressed to EU heads of state, EU heads of government, and EEA member states, warning of the: “terrible risk of further catastrophic loss of life as ever-more desperate people attempt this deadly sea crossing… commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues”112

86. Migrants’crossings continued at the same rate and in poor conditions, resulting in a continued need for SAR close to the Libyan coast, now lacking SAR protection previously afforded under Mare Nostrum.113

87. In numbers, the share of rescues under the Italian Navy decreased from 50 percent in 2014 to 26 percent in 2015, while the share of private sector’s commercial vessels increased to 30 percent.114

88. But gradually also the private sector followed the EU in an attempt to avoid responsibility to rescue migrants in distress at sea. In March 2015, UNHCR noted that as a result of the heavy financial losses incurred with search and rescue operations, shipping companies have started to re-route to avoid areas of heavy migrants’boats traffic. Private vessels have also become reluctant to reveal their positions at sea.115

89. According to the Italian coast guard, in 2014, with Mare Nostrum in place, 822 merchant vessels were re-directed by MRCC Rome to search and rescue events. Of these, 254 took refugees and migrants on board, rescuing a total of 42,061 people. According to the International Chamber of Shipping, in 2015, as of the beginning of April, 111 merchant ships were diverted to search and rescue calls in the central Mediterranean. 41 of these rescued 3,809 people.116 Many of these commercial vessels that were called upon by MRCC Rome to bear the burden of SAR were inadequately equipped and with crew not trained to operate SAR operations.

90. Since the end of Mare Nostrum, it was clear the means the EU provided are insufficient to tackle the multiple events in the critical SAR area: In one day, on 15 February, for example, 2,225 people were rescued from a dozen boats. Between 11 and 14 April, almost 10,000 people were rescued in multiple operations by Italian authorities, merchant ships and Triton assets.117

91. Notwithstanding the efforts of all actors involved – the Italian coast guard, the Italian Navy, the Armed Forces of Malta, merchant vessels and, on occasion, of Triton assets and crews - it is Amnesty International (‘AI’) estimates that as many as 900 men, women and children died or disappeared at sea in the central Mediterranean in the first three and a half months of 2015.118

92. The conclusions of an examination of specific cases, examined by AI, are that the gap in search and rescue resources left by Mare Nostrum and not filled by Triton is likely to have contributed to loss of life.119

93. In the events examined, refugee and migrants’ boats could have been spotted and assisted earlier, had more numerous assets been deployed further south. Finally, the deployment of professionalrescuersrather than assistanceby amerchantvesselcould haveprevented boatsin peril from capsizing.120

94. Under these conditions, the transition from MN to Triton naturally reflected a ‘death factor’ that had been anticipated by the relevant and above-cited EU agencies:121 Migrant mortality increased 30 times, from 2 deaths per 1000 crossings to 60 deaths per 1000 crossings, peaking in February and April 2015.122

It will clearly be much more difficult for merchant ships to save lives at sea without the adequate provision of search and rescue services by EU Member States.” World Maritime News, 2015, “ICS: Rescue of all persons in distress at sea is a must”, p. 1, online, http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/141521/ics-rescue-of-all-persons-in-distress-at-sea-is-a-must/ , accessed 27/02/2019; Even further, on March 31, 2015 a coalition of shipping industry organizations wrote an open letter to the EU member states and institutions writing that: ““The humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean Sea is spiraling out of control. […] There is a terrible risk of further catastrophic loss of life as ever-more desperate people attempt this deadly sea crossing. […] We believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues […]. Commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues […]. In the short term, we therefore feel that the immediate priority must be for EU and EEA Member States to increase resources and support for Search and Rescue operations in the Mediterranean, in view of the very large number of potentially dangerous rescues now being conducted by merchant ships […]. In addition to increasing SAR resources, there is also an urgent need for EU and EEA Member States to develop a political solution. […] The shipping industry believes that the EU and the international community need to provide refugees and migrants with alternative means of finding safety without risking their lives by crossing the Mediterranean in unseaworthy boats.” European Community Shipowners’Associations (ECSA) and the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), 2015, “Letter to the Heads of State / Heads of Government of EU/EEAMember States - Humanitarian Crisis in Mediterranean Sea”, online, http://www.statewatch.org/news/2015/apr/eu-med-shipping-industry-letter-eu-heads-of-state.pdf , accessed 25/02/2019.


95. For example, two events in January 22nd and February 8th 2015, resulted in an estimated 365 deaths as a result of this gap in SAR protection.123 In the January case, 8 days passed before a migrant boat was detected by Malta patrol boats, one of which was under Triton’s operations, and while these patrol boats came within 30 minutes of detection and saved 88 migrants, 34 migrants died from not being detected within the Triton zone soon enough.124

96. The February 8th event involved four boats, whereby as a result of inter alia limited availability of Triton vessels, it took up to 6.5 hours to reach some of the boats. This resulted in 330 deaths from the 420 migrants who left Libya, of which 29 of the deaths occurred from hypothermia during the 12 hour-long transport back to Lampedusa.125

97. According to UNHCR, despite the efforts of the Italian Coast Guard, Italian Navy, Malta Armed Forces, commercial ships, and Triton vessels, up to 900 migrants died or disappeared at sea during the first three and a half months of 2015.126 This is compared to 17 deaths or persons missing while crossing reported as of mid-April 2014 under Mare Nostrum.127 Comparing April 2014 and 2015, the number of drowned or missing migrants in April 2015 was 1308 compared to 42 for that same month the year before.128

98. Yet, crossings remained relatively similar with 20899 crossing as of mid-April 2014 compared to 21385 crossing as of mid-April 2015. The average number of victims per number of travelers had increased substantially, from 1 in 50 in 2014 under Mare Nostrum to 1 in 23 in 2015 under Triton.129

1.2.3 Cases: The Black Week of April

1st Case

99. Variouscivilsociety organizationssuch asAmnesty International, Forensic Architecture and others, have thoroughly analyzed numerous specific shipwrecks. Here we have chosen to focus on the infamous “black week”, which refers to the two successive shipwrecks on 12and 18 April 2015 in which a total of 1,200 migrants died.130

100. In the first case, on 12 April, around 600 to 700 migrants left the port of Zuwara (Libya) on a fishing boat. Shortly after departure, the engines of the vessel encountered difficulties and water started entering the boat.131 As the situation was becoming more dangerous, a distress called was issued to the Red Cross.132

101. However, it is unclear whether any specific action was undertaken by the Italian Coast Guard at the time, and who did advise the boat to continue navigating towards Lampedusa, in an attempt to come closer to SAR vessels in the area, as their vessel was still close to the Libyan coast.133

102. As the vessel continued northward to approach Italian coasts, it came across a supply vessel, the OOC Jaguar tug. The overloaded migrant vessel capsized as it was being approached by the other vessel. The OOC Jaguar tug eventually launched rescuing operation, but only after a “relatively long time” according to survivors.134

103. Two other tugboats, Asso Ventuno and Asso Ventiquattro, arrived on site immediately after the MRCC Rome sent out a distress call signaling the migrants’ vessel’s position.

104. Additionally, following MRCC Rome’s call requesting assistance, other assets were also deployed by the Italian Navy, the Italian Coast Guard, and a vessel financed by Frontex, the CP 324, to assist in the SAR operation.135

130 According to the UNHCR, arrivals in Italy increased from 2,238 in March 2015 to 16,063 in April of that same year. April 12th in particular saw a peak in the arrivals with a record of 3,791 people being rescued during that day alone.

105. However, these proved to be insufficient to rescue the many people on the capsized boat at sea.136 Overall, a total of 145 migrants were rescued. The death toll surpassed 400 people.

2nd Case

106. During the 2nd shipwreck on 18 April approximately 800 people were killed.137 In conditions similar to the previous shipwreck a week earlier, as the boat began to appear unstable, passengers issued a distress call to request assistance to the MRCC in Rome. Subsequently, the Italian Coast Guard issued a call to boats present in the area and sent a Coast Guard vessel to help in SAR operations.

107. The Portuguese flag vessel King Jacob, a large commercial vessel, identified the presence of the migrants’boat but, as they drew near, both vessels collided leading the migrants’embarkation to capsize and sink.

108. Rescue efforts were undertaken by the Portuguese flag-vessel and the Italian Coast Guard, rescuing 28 people and retrieving 24 bodies, estimating the total of deaths to over 800 people. The Italian Coast Guard refused to share evidence regarding the SAR operation and precise unfolding of events.138

109. Because of the incapacity of commercial vessels to fulfil the gap created by the end of MN despite its replacement by Triton. In both situations, hundreds of deaths were directly attributable to the policy change that as established above had been implemented by the EU and its state actors knowing these scenarios are likely to occur.

1.2.4 Post-April 2015 evidence: Triton upgraded

110. After intense media scrutiny and public outcry, the events of April’s black week forced European leaders to reckon with their responsibility in the deaths.

136 It should be noted that precise information on the operations during the time of the shipwreck is missing as MRCC Rome and Opielok Offshore Carriers GmbH (the supply vessel’s private company) did not share all the evidence.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi called for European solidarity while Maltese PM accused the European Union of “turn a blind eye to the plight of migrants.”139 Additionally, a spokesperson for the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon pointed out the need for a “robust search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean.”140

112. On 25 April 2015 the President of the European Commission itself, Jean-Claude Juncker, admitted:

113. “it wasa seriousmistaketo bring theMareNostrum operationto anend. It cost human lives.”141

114. EU policy was nonetheless by no means a mistake, as policymakers took the decision to replace Mare Nostrum by Triton in full awareness of the consequences of their acts, fully accepting that the change in policy would cause many preventable deaths, and that pursuing a policy of deterrence would lead to unnecessary deaths of those attempting to reach safety, against the responsibility of actors to uphold the interests of saving lives at sea.

115. On 23 April 2015, during an emergency summit, the European Council recognized the seriousness of the situation and planned to increase their presence in the Mediterranean as well as “reinforce internal solidarity and responsibility.”142

116. A significant part of these commitments focused on the reinforcement and expansion of Frontex’s Joint Operation Triton, which was by then presented as an answer to the humanitarian crisis the EU itself had triggered.143

117. On 29 April 2015, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution demanding a more committed response. The text adopted by the Parliament insists that SAR operations be “effectively fulfilled and therefore properly financed”144, while also advocating for a “permanent and humanitarian European rescue operation”, such as Mare Nostrum, “to extend its mandate for search and rescue operations.”145 It also “deplored the lack of commitment of the European Council.”146

118. As a result of these discussions, on 13 May 2015, European Agenda on Migration translated the concern for the persisting humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean, underlining the Member States’ commitment to adopt “concrete steps, notably to avert further loss of life”.147

119. It was clearly stated that the previous response deployed in the area - namely Operation Triton - was “immediate but insufficient”148 and instead, underlined the need to “restore the level of intervention provided under (…) ‘Mare Nostrum’.”149

120. It also put forward the proposal amended by the European Commission which tripled the budget – to the levels of MN - for the Frontex joint-operations Triton and Poseidon which allowed for a geographical expansion and increased assets for SAR and vigilance operations.150

121. On May 26th 2015, Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri signed the amended operation plan of the Joint Operation Triton significantly expanding Triton’s powers.151 Indeed, the enlargement and reinforcing of Triton’s mandate, far from creating a “European Mare Nostrum”, helped revealing the real nature of EU objectives in the zone.

122. Several elements were immediately noted by humanitarian actors. First, the extended operation, which the EU claimed was an answer to the humanitarian crisis, still did not have the same geographical scope as Mare Nostrum.152

151 The budget was tripled, providing additional 26.25 million euros for both Triton and Poseidon Sea operations, Triton’s budget resulting in 38 million EUR for 2015 while an additional 45 million were to be provided the following year for both operations. Additionally,theoperationalarea wasalsoextendedto138NMsouthofSicilywhile additionalassetssuchasoffshore patrolvessels, helicopters and personnel were also to be mobilized for during the summer period, which was marked by a particular high migrant influx, see FRONTEX, 2015, “Frontex expands its Joint Operation Triton”, News Release, online, https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news-release/frontex-expands-its-joint-operation-triton-udpbHP)\_, accessed 10/04/2019https://frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/news-release/frontex-expands-its-joint-operation-triton-udpbHP)\_



123. Second, the upgraded Triton based itself on the premise of a border control operation, rather than a SAR operation.153 So did the new operation European Union Naval Force Mediterranean (EUNAFORMED), officially launched on June 22nd 2015, which was a novel military operation at sea charged with the mandate of carrying out military action against smugglers and traffickers in Libyan territorial waters.154

124. As noted above, private sector acotrs attempted to avoid the financial loss rescue missions incurred, and subsequently there was a dramatic decrease in the number of commercial ships being mobilized for SAR operations, de-correlated to the number of crossings. While in the first five months of 2015, commercial vessels rescued 11,954 persons, between June and September this number reduced to 3 689 individuals (hence, dropping from 30% to 4% of all rescues.155

125. Consequently, NGOs interventions in the Mediterranean to provide life-saving assistance to migrants sharply raised, quickly making of them a “veritable civilian rescue flotilla” that fills the gap created by the EU institutions.156

126. Mainly patrolling the waters previously covered by MN, between Tripoli and Zuwara, by the end of October 2015 NGO vessels had already managed to rescue more than 18,000 individuals (7.6% of all rescued).157

127. If the 1st EU policy aspired to convey a ‘we are not there (anymore)’message, by gradually albeit still partially filling the SAR gap, rescue NGOs communicated the humanitarian message that ‘someone is there’, complying with the duties of both safe rescue and safe disembarkation.

128. If EU officials were genuinely concerned by the loss of lives in the Mediterranean and wished to constructively act to avoid any further loss of lives, then they should have welcomed the presence of rescue NGOs who provided and alternative to the failure of State duties in preventing loss of lives and protecting the rights of individuals under their effective control.

129. The fact the EU moved to persecution by prosecution of NGOs reveals the objective of EU deterrence-based policies in the Mediterranean to stem migration flows to Europe at all costs, including the killing of thousands of innocent civilians fleeing an area of an armed conflict and located under the effective control of EU and its Member States.

130. It is in this sense that the EU shift to a new policy has to be understood. Instead of prioritizing urgent humanitarian response to tackle the loss of life of individuals under its control, the EU moved to distinguish a human category to facilitate the mistreatment of its imagined members.

131. What initially appeared to be too inhumane to be even conceivable – recalling the shocked reaction to ‘the left to die boat’incident or the Lampedusa shipwrecks – what was at first covered up by an emphatic discourse, would be throughout the years more and more explicitly assumed.

132. As the next section demonstrates, from a withdrawal of budgets, assets and operations that characterized the policy of non-assistance in the Mediterranean (EU’s 1st Policy), the EU drastically moved to the other end by manifesting full military, strategic and tactical control, not only in High Seas or off the Libyan shores, but also in Libyan territorial waters and even on land (EU’s 2nd Policy).

133. From pretending to be powerless and without the means to allocate 9 million Euros for the continuation of an humanitarian endeavor operated by one frontline Member State, EU actors and institutions passed to a demonstration of force and the spending of tens of millions of Euros to prevent the departures, crossings and arrivals of migrants.

134. From pretending to take into account humanitarian considerations, EU actors and institutions acted more and more aggressively towards any actor that would interfere in their strategy, and at the same time chose to contract with the most aggressive actors to have them implement their unlawful and criminal strategy.

135. As the next section outlines, the new EU policy therefore conveyed a different message: ‘someone else – i.e. instead of rescue NGOs - should be there’. That ‘someone’must be willing to fully obey EU orders to contain migration in Libya, and would be able to use whatever including unlawful means to this end.


136. EU agents were fully aware there was no possibility to stem the flows of people fleeing violence without violating international obligations. This is why in the post-Hirsi era, that ‘someone’ could no longer be the EU itself.

137. That ‘someone’ had to be corrupt enough to be involved with atrocious crimes EU agents would be aware of and would do whatever they could, albeit unsuccessfully, not to be directly implicated with. That someone was a militia known as the Libyan Coast Guard.

138. The next section focuses on EU 2nd policy which orchestrated the commission of the alleged atrocious crimes, this time not by omission, but by proxy. This policy had two key components: the first was the ousting of the NGOs that filled the SAR gap and failed EU 1st policy; the second was the establishment of an armed group to replace the NGOs in order to implement a widespread and systematic campaign of forced collective expulsions of those who somehow managed to flee Libya.


1.3 2nd Policy: Libya (2015-2018)

1.3.1 Introduction: The renaissance of Border Externalization

139. The 2nd EU Policy, which is still ongoing, was framed in light of two insights: first, that migrants in Libya are so desperate to escape that the risk of dying by drowning fails to deter them; second, that mass shipwrecks such as the Black April incidents are intolerable for the public opinion. The old-new EU policy, however, would not aim to protect the life and liberty of migrants, but to ensure that killing and other crimes against them would be committed, and stay, far from public eye.

140. TheLibyan 2011 uprisingended 40 yearsof Gaddafi’srule, and Libyabecamefertileground for lawlessness: widespread violence including torture and sexual abuses, criminal activities including smuggling and human trafficking, started being largely facilitated by State institutions and non-state armed groups.158

141. In February 2011, the United Nations Security Council (‘UNSC’) unanimously referred the situation in Libya to the ICC (Resolution 1970).159 And on 17 March 2011, the UNSC demanded an immediate ceasefire and authorized all necessary means to protect civilians (Resolution 1973). This resolution provided the legal basis for the NATO-led military intervention launched on 19 March 2011.160

142. But armed hostilities escalated in mid-2014, further inhibiting the functioning of the domestic system of governance. Political chaos failed attempts by the EU and Italy to resort to their former push-back policy.

158 A confidential UN Panel of Experts Report from expressed concern “over the possible use of state facilities and state funds by armed groups and traffickers to enhance their control of migration routes.” See The Migrant Project, “UN report accuses Libyan Security forces of colluding with smugglers and traffickers in Libya.”, online https://www.themigrantproject.org/libya-un/, accessed 11/04/2019

159 In March 2011, the Office of the Prosecutor (‘OTP’) at the ICC opened its investigation into crimes against humanity and war crimes. See: United Nations Security Council, 2011, “Security Council Resolution 1970”, online, http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/doc/1970, accessed11/04/2019andInternationalCriminalCourt, 2019,“SituationinLibya”, online, https://www.icc-cpi.int/libya, accessed 11/04/2019

143. Given the ongoing armed conflict in Libya, it was clear to EU agencies and agents that in the post-Hirsi era, Member States and EU bodies including Frontex would be “fully accountable for all actions and decisions under its mandate”.161

144. Specifically, in a memo dated 7 October 2014, the European expressly acknowledged and manifested its awareness that push-backs constitute a grave violation of international law and in particular the principle of non-refoulement: “as for all Frontex operation, Triton will be operating in full respect with international and EU obligations, including respect of fundamental rights and of the principle of non-refoulement which excludes push backs.”162

145. The situation in Libya was and is so “dire and unacceptable”,163 as the ICC Prosecutor observed, that not only refoulement appeared inconceivable for Frontex, but on the contrary the evacuation of civilians from the country showed to be indispensable.

146. In October2015 the UNHCR called all countries to allow civilians to enter their territories, underlying that no country should, once survivors succeeded fleeing Libya, disembark them in Libya which could not be considered as a place of safety: “As the situation in Libya remains fluid and uncertain, UNHCR calls on all countries to allow civilians … fleeing Libya access to their territories.”164

147. Furthermore, UNHCR clarified that it “does not consider that Libya meets the criteria for being designated as a place of safety for the purpose of disembarkation following rescue at sea.”165

148. A place of safety for disembarkation as defined by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee involves a place where the survivors’ “safety of life is no longerthreatened and where theirbasic human needs (such as food, shelter and medical needs) can be met.”166

149. In the case of asylum seekers rescued at sea, a place of safety is also including “the need to avoid disembarkation in territories where the lives and freedoms of those alleging a well-founded fear of persecution would be threatened.”167

150. This further complicated the position of EU actors, who were caught into more and more intense contradiction between their political objectives and their legal obligations.

151. Any direct contact between EU agents and survivors from Libya would have resulted in disembarkation in Europe. In the political and legal situation in which the EU was unable to resort to its push-back policy, there was only one other body the EU could contract with that would be willing to execute this policy for the EU, i.e. the Libyan Coast Guard.

152. On 17 December 2015, facilitated by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (‘UNSMIL’), different fractions signed the Libyan Political Agreement and established a Presidency Council with Prime Minister Serraj as the head of the Government of National Accord (‘GNA’)168.

153. The Libyan Political Agreement, however, did not cease hostilities. In March 2016, the Presidential Council of the GNA installed itself in Tripoli, but failed to take control of all the ministries and institutions. In the meantime, other authorities still tried to take control over infrastructures and struggled for legitimacy.169

154. In the absence of effective state control over the national territory, armed groups continued to fightand commithuman rightsviolations, and thehumanitarian crisisfurther escalated,mounting to around 0.5 million internally displaced people (IDPs).170

155. As the ICC Prosecutor observed, the ongoing armed conflict and lack of government was leading to “[S]erious and widespread crimes allegedly committed against migrants attempting to transit through Libya…thousands of vulnerable migrants, including women and children, are being held in detention centres across Libya in often inhumane conditions. Crimes, including killings, rapes and torture, are alleged to be commonplace… credible accounts that Libya has become a marketplace for the trafficking of human beings… The situation is both dire and unacceptable… We must act…”.171

156. The ICC investigation has been pending since 2011. In the meantime, the EU kept on acting. Closing off the Central Mediterranean route required intensifying control while avoiding contact that would oblige the EU to save the lives of those fleeing Libya.

157. In order to do so, the EU adopted two-pronged strategy: (1) delegitimizing, criminalizing and ultimately ousting NGOs who remained committed safe rescue and disembarkation172; and (2) using a 3rd party that would agree to replace recue with interception, refoulement and detention of those escaping Libya.

158. Evidence provided below show that EU policy to stem migration from Libya – despite the absolute prohibition on refoulement to Libya and the duty to facilitate access to those fleeing the country – has been successfully accomplished.

159. Through aseriesof pseudo-legalagreementsand multiformsupportto theLYCG, EUagents have managed to exercise full strategic and operational control over Libyan territory, at sea and in land.173

160. This policy is still ongoing and lets almost no survivor to reach safe haven. Between 2016-2018, 40,000 survivors that somehow managed to escape the living hell in Libya were pushed-back as a result of the EU policy that is described below, in violation of numerous legal conventions, including the Rome Statute.

1.3.2 The NGOs: ‘Someone Else Should Be There’

161. In response to the EU’s decision to decrease SAR operations in the Mediterranean, rescue NGOs became critical actors in responding to the “protection gap”. The presence of rescue NGOs in lieu of the EU vessels failed the deterrence-based policy aimed to create a lethal SAR gap.

162. After the termination of Mare Nostrum in 2014, NGOs stepped up to provide SAR and fill the ‘rescue gap’ in the face of the deteriorating humanitarian crisis. Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) was the first to step in, followed by the Amsterdam, Brussels and Barcelona Sections of MSF.174

163. In 2015 MOAS and MSF were joined by Sea-Watch175 and in 2016 several new missions were deployed in the Mediterranean by SAR NGOs: SOS Mediterannée, Sea-Eye, Jugend Rettet, Life Boat, Proactivia Open Arms, Bootvuchtling and Safe the Children. Mission Lifeline started SAR operations in 2017.176 At the peak, 12 vessels were dispatched” (see Table below)177.

164. NGOs rescued one quarter of all those rescued in 2016, and one-third of all those rescued in the first three months of 2017.178 As characterized by Federico Soda, Italy’s director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) – “The NGOs are present to fill a lifesaving gap in the absence of a state-led response to reduce the loss of lives”179.

165. But as part of the premeditated attack on civilians fleeing the detention centers and torture houses in Libya, EU and Italian actors launched a broad political persecution against rescue NGOs, which includes intimidation, defamation, harassment, and formal criminalization.180

166. The criminalization of the rescuers was a key strategy of the overarching EU 2nd policy aimed at preventing - at all costs - the exit, let alone arrival of persons in need of international protection181, as this attack against NGOs was a precondition for ensuring the LYCG alone could push back migrants to Libya.182
